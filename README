Run command:
sh test_script.sh

I ran the following set of test cases and tested the code:
Positive tests are in files positive_test1, and positive_test2
Negative tests are in file negative_test1

positive_test1 will check the valid url taken from user while prompting for 'new target url' and will run a dummy query
positive_test1 will check the valid url taken from user while initialization and will run a dummy query

negative_test1 will print an error when we ran a query with no valid url, and it shows the session terminated when we reach max. no. of tries are reached

I would add more test cases if I have more time
